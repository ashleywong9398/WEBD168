      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I have a happy family and I'm a mother of two children. 
        Currently, I have a job unrelated to web design, which I don't particularly enjoy. 
        I tend to be a bit introverted and prefer working in a quiet environment. 
        I'm still learning English, aiming to improve my language skills. That's a bit about me.
      </p>

      <h2>Reasons and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I am studying this course because I have a passion for design, and creating beautiful things brings me great satisfaction. 
        Choosing this profession also aligns with my personality. 
        I hope that completing this course will enhance my abilities in web design and help me find a suitable job.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
            I studied C language and C++ in China over a decade ago, 
            and I am proficient in using workflow control version control software such as Jira and SVN. 
            I enjoy using Photoshop and have created a mobile game in the past. 
            Later on, I worked in a game company in testing and quality management roles.
             Last semester, I started studying web design courses and found myself very interested in this field.
